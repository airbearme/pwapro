## 2025-05-15 - Infrastructural UX Foundations

**Learning:** Micro-UX improvements like tooltips or focus indicators often require infrastructural setup (e.g., `TooltipProvider`, `id="main-content"`). Implementing these foundations enables consistent UX patterns across the entire application, making future small enhancements easier and more robust.

**Action:** Always check for the presence of provider components in the root layout before implementing dependent UI elements. Pair infrastructural changes with at least one visible implementation to demonstrate value.
