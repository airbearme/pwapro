## 2025-05-15 - Accessible Icon Buttons with Native Tooltips
**Learning:** In a constrained environment where line count matters, using the native 'title' attribute along with 'aria-label' provides a solid micro-UX improvement for icon-only buttons without the overhead of UI library tooltips and providers.
**Action:** Use 'aria-label' for screen readers and 'title' for simple hover hints when line count constraints prevent using complex tooltip components.
