## 2025-05-14 - [Tooltip & ARIA Label Synergy]
**Learning:** Adding a specific `aria-label` to an otherwise ambiguous element (like an icon-only button) is an effective strategy to create a unique, reliable selector for frontend verification tests while also improving accessibility. Pairing this with a Radix UI Tooltip provides immediate visual feedback for sighted users, completing the UX loop.
**Action:** Always pair icon-only buttons with both an `aria-label` and a `Tooltip` to ensure accessibility for both screen reader and sighted users.
