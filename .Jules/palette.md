## 2025-05-14 - [Layout Accessibility Enhancements]
**Learning:** Adding a "Skip to content" link and sitewide `TooltipProvider` in the root layout provides a strong foundation for accessibility and user guidance. Infrastructural changes like `TooltipProvider` must be paired with at least one user-facing implementation (e.g., a theme toggle tooltip) to be considered a complete UX improvement.
**Action:** Always check for "Skip to content" links in new projects and ensure icon-only buttons have tooltips and ARIA labels.
