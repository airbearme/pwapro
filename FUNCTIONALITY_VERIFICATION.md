## 🔍 **Potential Issues & Fixes**

### **Issue 1: Missing Ride ID in Payment Flow** ⚠️

**Problem**: RidePayment component doesn't pass rideId to CheckoutButton
**Impact**: Payment metadata may not include ride association
**Fix Needed**: Pass rideId in payment items metadata

### **Issue 2: Payment Success Callback** ⚠️

**Problem**: handleCardPayment in RidePayment uses timeout instead of actual payment verification
**Impact**: Payment may appear successful even if it fails
**Fix Needed**: Integrate with actual Stripe payment confirmation

### **Issue 3: Ride Status Updates** ⚠️

**Problem**: Ride status not updated after successful payment
**Impact**: Ride remains in "pending" state
**Fix Needed**: Update ride status to "confirmed" after payment

---

## 🛠️ **Recommended Fixes**

### **Fix 1: Enhanced Payment Integration**

```typescript
// In RidePayment component
const handleCardPayment = async () => {
  setProcessing(true);
  // Pass ride information to CheckoutButton
  await router.push(`/checkout?rideId=${ride.id}&amount=${ride.fare}`);
};
```

### **Fix 2: Payment Confirmation**

```typescript
// In checkout page, update ride status after payment
const updateRideStatus = async (rideId: string) => {
  const supabase = getSupabaseClient();
  await supabase
    .from("rides")
    .update({ status: "confirmed", paid_at: new Date().toISOString() })
    .eq("id", rideId);
};
```

### **Fix 3: Enhanced Error Handling**

```typescript
// Add better error messages and retry logic
const handlePaymentError = (error: any) => {
  toast({
    title: "Payment Failed",
    description: error.message || "Please try again",
    variant: "destructive",
  });
};
```
