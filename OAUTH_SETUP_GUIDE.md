## Troubleshooting

### Google OAuth Issues

**Error: "redirect_uri_mismatch"**
- Check that `https://fofmrqgcidfenbevayrg.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` is in your authorized redirect URIs
- Make sure there are no trailing slashes

**Error: "Access blocked: This app's request is invalid"**
- Complete the OAuth consent screen configuration
- Add test users if app is in testing mode

### Apple Sign In Issues

**Error: "invalid_client"**
- Verify Services ID matches exactly
- Check that domains are configured correctly
- Ensure .p8 key is copied completely (including BEGIN/END lines)

**Error: "unauthorized_client"**
- Make sure Sign In with Apple is enabled for both App ID and Services ID
- Verify return URLs match exactly

### General Issues

**Users not appearing in Supabase**
- Check Authentication → Users in Supabase dashboard
- Verify email confirmation is not required (or is handled)

**Redirect not working**
- Clear browser cache
- Try incognito/private mode
- Check browser console for errors

---

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit OAuth secrets to Git**
   - Keep them in Supabase dashboard only
   - Use environment variables for any server-side code

2. **Use HTTPS only**
   - OAuth will not work over HTTP
   - airbear.me already has HTTPS ✓

3. **Limit OAuth scopes**
   - Only request email and profile
   - Don't ask for unnecessary permissions

4. **Monitor OAuth usage**
   - Check Google Cloud Console quotas
   - Review Apple Developer Console analytics

---

## Next Steps After Setup

Once OAuth is configured:

1. **Update Auth UI** (optional):
   - Add Google/Apple buttons to login page
   - Customize button styling

2. **Handle User Profiles**:
   - User data automatically syncs to Supabase
   - Profile photos from Google/Apple are available

3. **Test Thoroughly**:
   - Test on mobile devices
   - Test with different accounts
   - Verify logout works correctly

## Cost Summary

- **Google OAuth**: Free (no cost)
- **Apple Sign In**: Requires Apple Developer Program ($99/year)
- **Supabase Auth**: Free tier includes OAuth
