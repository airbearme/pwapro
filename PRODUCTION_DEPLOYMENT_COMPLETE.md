3. Select events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. Copy the webhook signing secret
5. Add to Vercel environment variables as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### Step 4: Configure OAuth Providers in Supabase

**Google OAuth:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers
2. Enable Google provider
3. Add redirect URL: `https://airbear.me/auth/callback`

### Step 5: Initialize Database

Run the database setup script:
```bash
# The schema is in scripts/01-setup-database.sql
# Execute via Supabase SQL Editor or CLI
```

### Step 6: Deploy via GitHub

```bash
# Push to main branch - GitHub Actions will auto-deploy
git add .
git commit -m "Production deployment to airbear.me"
git push origin main
```

**OR deploy manually:**
```bash
npm run deploy:vercel
```

### Step 7: Verify Deployment
