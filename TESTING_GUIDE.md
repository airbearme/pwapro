## 🔒 Security Testing

### RLS Policies

```sql
-- Test in Supabase SQL Editor with different user contexts

-- 1. Test as anonymous user
SELECT * FROM profiles;
-- Should return NO rows

-- 2. Test as authenticated user
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();
-- Should return ONLY your profile

-- 3. Test insert (should fail for other users)
INSERT INTO profiles (id, email) VALUES ('random-id', 'test@test.com');
-- Should ERROR: "new row violates row-level security policy"

-- 4. Test airbears table (public read)
SELECT * FROM airbears;
-- Should return all rows (public readable)

-- 5. Test orders table (own orders only)
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
-- Should return only YOUR orders
```

### Environment Variable Security

```bash
# Verify no secrets in client bundle
npm run build
grep -r "sk_live_" .next/static
# Should return NO results

grep -r "SERVICE_ROLE" .next/static
# Should return NO results
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Map Not Loading

**Issue:** Blank white box instead of map

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Check app/globals.css has Leaflet styles
@import url('https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css');

// Check map-view.tsx loads Leaflet dynamically
const MapComponent = dynamic(() => import("@/components/map-view"), {
  ssr: false
})
```

### OAuth Redirect Loop

**Issue:** Keeps redirecting after OAuth login

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Check middleware.ts doesn't block auth callback
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|auth|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)']
}
```

### Stripe Webhook Fails

**Issue:** Payments work but orders not created

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify webhook signature
# In app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts
const sig = headers().get('stripe-signature')
stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(body, sig, webhookSecret)
```

### Real-time Not Updating

**Issue:** Map doesn't update locations

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Enable realtime in Supabase
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE airbears;

-- Check RLS allows reads
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read" ON airbears FOR SELECT USING (true);
```
