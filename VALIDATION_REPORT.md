## 🚨 Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Missing PWA Files (HIGH PRIORITY)
\`\`\`bash
# Missing files:
- /public/manifest.json
- /public/sw.js (service worker)
\`\`\`

**Impact**: App cannot be installed as PWA on mobile devices
**Solution**: Create proper PWA manifest and service worker

### 2. Bundle Size Optimization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
\`\`\`bash
# Current build size:
- Main bundle: 686KB (205KB gzipped)
- CSS: 100KB (17KB gzipped)
\`\`\`

**Impact**: Slower initial load times, especially on mobile
**Solution**: Implement code splitting and dynamic imports
