Enhance the Airbear PWA (solar-powered Airbear ride-sharing with onboard bodegas in Binghamton, NY) from GitHub repo /airbearme/airbearpwa (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Stripe) to be the most beautiful, aesthetic app ever, with the most special effects before seen. Use free tools only: Leaflet.js for maps, Supabase (free tier for auth/DB/storage/real-time), Stripe (free account except transaction fees), Framer Motion/GSAP/Lottie/Rive for effects. Ensure static export for IONOS Deploy Now upload after completion, with PWA installable via single-click add-to-home prompt. Structure with 3 unified sections (role-based, working in unison): 1. Driver (manage Airbear/inventory, confirm rides/payments, real-time tracking); 2. User/Passenger (book rides/shop bodega, view history); 3. Admin (analytics, oversee users/drivers). Binghamton map: Aesthetic eco-luxury style (gradients, holographics), real-time updates on spot click (instant ETA/distance via Leaflet/Supabase), mini Airbear logos as markers (spinning on hover). Replace all "rickshaw/tut tut" with "Airbear". Add startup promo: $100 CEO-signed T-shirt (unlimited rides/year, small print: 1 ride/day, non-transferable, purchaser only)—integrate in signup flow. Require End User Agreement acceptance on registration. Add ad hosting: Silver/Gold/Platinum packages (on website or Airbear's LED banners/35+ inch screen). Place Airbear logo everywhere (header, footer, map, buttons, splash). Create catchy rhyming slogans (e.g., "Airbear flair, ride without a care—solar power in the air!"; "Glide with Airbear, eco-rides so rare—bodega treats beyond compare!"; "Buy the tee, ride for free—Airbear's your eco-key!"; "Zip with Airbear, no fare despair—solar fun everywhere!"; "Airbear's glow, let the good times flow—rides and snacks on the go!"). Maximize special effects: Spinning Airbear wheels (smoking/on fire with neon illuminations, holographic trails); rolling wheels burning out/smoking/catching fire sparks; sun rays beaming down creating prism color spectrums; clean air breezes with fluttering plant leaves/particles; clear pathways with mini Airbears (no traffic, real-time location icons); solar winds/fireflies/confetti storms/liquid morphs/3D tilts/ripples/glows/glitches/blooms/heat distortions/vortex zooms/morphing shapes/god-rays/plasma glows/fractal loads/kaleidoscope themes; haptics/audio sync (whooshes/spins); particle systems (winds/fireflies/leaf swarms); infinite auroras/eclipses; wind-swept distortions; rubber snaps/staggered bursts/bouncing trails/spatial rotations/emoji explosions/typewriter reveals. Optimize for mobile, 60fps, low-power. Upload to IONOS FTP (ftp.airbear.me) post-completion, verify single-click PWA install. Output updated code, README, commit to repo.
