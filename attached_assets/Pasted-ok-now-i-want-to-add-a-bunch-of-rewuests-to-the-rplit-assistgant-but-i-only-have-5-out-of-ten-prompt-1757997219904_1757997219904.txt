ok now i want to add a bunch of rewuests to the rplit assistgant but i only have 5 out of ten prompts already used. first i want to make sure that this gets uploaded to ionos after everything is completed on this list and the pwa can install and download with a single click from ionos after its uploaded. there must be 3 seperate portions to the app and they are 1 driver 2 user/passanger, and 3 the admin. all three muat all work in unison with eachother . the map of binghamton needs to be aestetic and jpdate in realtime as soon as a destination is clicked on and the eta and distance should update instantly and accurately as well. we must use all free sources for the whole app code , we always want to use the best functioning with the most aestetic while maintaining it for ree like leaflet supabase stripe free account except transaction fees etc. need this with the most special effects as possible to mak it the most beautiful app ever created. spinning rickshaw wheels smoking and on fire with holographics neon illuinations etc etc any other special effects to enhace this in any way. need to have a startup promotional offer of $100 t shirt signed by the ceo with unlimited rides for a year over a 1500 dollar value . small print would say unlimited rides only includes i ride per day and only applies to the purchaser and its non transferrrible. when the user signs up and registers they must agree to an end user agreement.  we also want to host ads in a silver gold and platinum package either on the website or we have 2 kled banners and a 35 plus inch screen on the airbear. replace anything that says rickshaw or tut tut with Airbear. come up with catchy rhyming slogans kind of like where the tee airbear solar ride share ride for free or pay the small 4 dollar fee. u can go anywhere with airbear the mobile bodega and solar ride share . just buy the tee and ride for free or pay the small 4 dollar fee. less than half the price of uber or lift and u will still get there in a zip . i dont know come up with something better than those for me please. and we must replace and put the logo everywhere it needs to be and have mini airbear logos as markers on the map. anything else to make this the most aesttic with the most special effects ever before seen like rolling rickshaw wheels burning out smokin or catching fire sun rays beaming down and creating the color spectrum like through a prism clean air breezes and plant leaves. clear pathways with airbears and no traffic etc etc any other special effects mobile mini rickshaws showing cureent location on the maps. rewrite this to make this the best prompt for the replit assistantThought for 14sEnhance the Airbear PWA (solar-powered Airbear ride-sharing with onboard bodegas in Binghamton, NY) from GitHub repo /airbearme/airbearpwa (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Stripe) to be the most beautiful, aesthetic app ever, with the most special effects before seen. Use free tools only: Leaflet.js for maps, Supabase (free tier for auth/DB/storage/real-time), Stripe (free account except transaction fees), Framer Motion/GSAP/Lottie/Rive for effects. Ensure static export for IONOS Deploy Now upload after completion, with PWA installable via single-click add-to-home prompt. Structure with 3 unified sections (role-based, working in unison): 1. Driver (manage Airbear/inventory, confirm rides/payments, real-time tracking); 2. User/Passenger (book rides/shop bodega, view history); 3. Admin (analytics, oversee users/drivers). Binghamton map: Aesthetic eco-luxury style (gradients, holographics), real-time updates on spot click (instant ETA/distance via Leaflet/Supabase), mini Airbear logos as markers (spinning on hover). Replace all "rickshaw/tut tut" with "Airbear". Add startup promo: $100 CEO-signed T-shirt (unlimited rides/year, small print: 1 ride/day, non-transferable, purchaser only)—integrate in signup flow. Require End User Agreement acceptance on registration. Add ad hosting: Silver/Gold/Platinum packages (on website or Airbear's LED banners/35+ inch screen). Place Airbear logo everywhere (header, footer, map, buttons, splash). Create catchy rhyming slogans (e.g., "Airbear flair, ride without a care—solar power in the air!"; "Glide with Airbear, eco-rides so rare—bodega treats beyond compare!"; "Buy the tee, ride for free—Airbear's your eco-key!"; "Zip with Airbear, no fare despair—solar fun everywhere!"; "Airbear's glow, let the good times flow—rides and snacks on the go!"). Maximize special effects: Spinning Airbear wheels (smoking/on fire with neon illuminations, holographic trails); rolling wheels burning out/smoking/catching fire sparks; sun rays beaming down creating prism color spectrums; clean air breezes with fluttering plant leaves/particles; clear pathways with mini Airbears (no traffic, real-time location icons); solar winds/fireflies/confetti storms/liquid morphs/3D tilts/ripples/glows/glitches/blooms/heat distortions/vortex zooms/morphing shapes/god-rays/plasma glows/fractal loads/kaleidoscope themes; haptics/audio sync (whooshes/spins); particle systems (winds/fireflies/leaf swarms); infinite auroras/eclipses; wind-swept distortions; rubber snaps/staggered bursts/bouncing trails/spatial rotations/emoji explosions/typewriter reveals. Optimize for mobile, 60fps, low-power. Upload to IONOS FTP (ftp.airbear.me) post-completion, verify single-click PWA install. Output updated code, README, commit to repo.4.6sExpertHow can Grok help?
